            <p>
                This project is built as a Single Page Application (SPA) using React.js 
                and modern JavaScript (ES6+). It aims to demonstrate proficiency in 
                component-based architecture, client-side routing, and complex state 
                manipulation for data filtering and sorting.
            </p>

            <p>
                The primary goal is to display a list of mock book data and allow the user 
                to filter and sort this list simultaneously using native JavaScript array methods, 
                [span_1](start_span)as required by the project specifications.[span_1](end_span)
            </p>
